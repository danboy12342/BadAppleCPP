 Console ouptut in real time

 Video demo [here](https://youtu.be/mRjDmoA1K0A)
 
 Known issues:
 Output console video does not match the speed of the original video if the source framerate is not 30 fps as the original Bad Apple video I tested the code with. I don't know if it's due to a math error or the fact that the code can't deal with fractional fps. I'll have to look into it once I have the free time to do so.
